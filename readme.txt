= Registration - How it makes us better =
Our very simple and easy registration lets you register with miniOrange. miniOrange takes care of creating applications for you. In any other social login, if you are providing login with facebook for example, you will need an App ID for which you will need to create an entire application in facebook and so if you want to provide login with 10 social apps then you need to go and create 10 apps in those social platforms. Using our plugin you do not need to do that. Just by creating one registration with us, you get social login plus other features.
